title: Lesson 13 - Make the snake die when it eats itself!</h1>
lesson_js: lesson-13.js
---
<p>The last thing we need to do is check to see if the snake ran into itself.</p>

{% highlight js %}
var ate = function(snake, otherThing) {
  var head = snake[0];
  return CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween([head], otherThing);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>We've created an `ate` function that accepts a snake and the previous version of the snake. We can also think about passing the `ate` function other things, which we'll get into in a bit. In `ate` we also reuse the `detectCollisionBetween` to find out if there's a collision.</p>

<p>Now we just have to check if the `newSnake` ate it's previous self to see if there was a collision! We do this by calling the `ate` function inside of `advanceGame`.</p>

{% highlight js %}
var advanceGame = function() {
  var newSnake = moveSnake(snake);

  if (ate(newSnake, snake)) {
    CHUNK.endGame();
    CHUNK.flashMessage("Woops! You ate yourself!");
  } 

  if (ate(newSnake, [apple])) {
    newSnake = growSnake(newSnake);
    apple = CHUNK.randomLocation();
  }

  if (ate(newSnake, CHUNK.gameBoundaries())) {
    CHUNK.endGame();
    CHUNK.flashMessage("Woops! you hit a wall!");
  }

  snake = newSnake;
  draw(snake, apple);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Notice, we've abstracted out the `ate` function by resuing it. It can now determine if the snake ate itself, an apple or the wall.</p>

<h3>Congratulations! You've built the snake game!</h3>

<p>If you want your friends and family to be able to play your game, you'll need
to put it online. Lesson 14 includes instructions on <a
