title: Lesson 2 - Drawing the Snake
lesson_js: lesson-2.js
---
<p>To get started, we want to create a `variable` that represents the
snake. Add the following line to the beginning of game/snake.js:</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
{% endhighlight %}


<p>Now that we have this amazing snake we want to show it off, right?
Thankfully, the CHUNK game engine makes it easy to draw on
the screen. Let's tell CHUNK to `draw` our `snake`!</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snake };
  CHUNK.draw([drawableSnake]);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Every time you change your `snake.js` file, you'll want to save it and
refresh the browser page that has the index.html in it</p>

<p>Congratulations, by the way! You've drawn a very-short snake on the screen.</p>

<h3>How the computer is interpreting this code:</h3>
<p>Imagine the computer is named Sean and can understand English. This is a
reasonable approximation of what we're telling Sean:</p>


<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Sean!</p>

  <p>First, get me a box and label it "snake." Then grab a note-card,
  label it "top" put a 0 on it. Grab another card, label it "left"
  and put a 0 on it. Put the note-card in the box.</p>

  <p>Second, grab another box and label it `drawableSnake`. Add a note card
  labeled "color" and put "green" on it. Add another note card labeled "snake"
  and put "See the box labeled snake" on it.</p>

  <p>Third, create a list with the `drawableSnake` in it. Then get the value of
  `draw` from the `CHUNK` object and execute it with that list.</p>
</blockquote>

{% include expected-results.html %}

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Add comments underneath each line explaining what it does in plain old
  english.</li>
  <li>Change the color of the snake.</li>
  <li>Make the snake longer than just 1 segment!</li>
  <li>Draw something in addition to the snake. Perhaps an apple or a wall? Make
  sure it's a different color!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`var` tells the computer to create a variable (in this case named `snake`)
that we can assign a value to.</p>

<p>`=` (single equals sign) tells the computer to assign the value on the
right of the `=` to the variable on the left of the `=`.</p>

<p>`[` and `]` (square brackets) come in pairs. They wrap around one or more
values to make a list (often called an array).</p>

<p>`{` and `}` (curly braces) also come in pairs. In this case they wrap around
pairs of names and values to create an `object` (sometimes called a
`hashmap`). (Note: There is another use of curly braces which we will see
later.)</p>

<p>`:` (colon - when creating an object) says to create a variable within the
object. It's name (or key) is on the left side of the `:` and it's value is
on the right.</p>

<p>`,` (comma - when creating an object or map) is used to separate key/value
pairs on the object.</p>

<p>`;` (semicolon) says "This line is over. Thanks!"</p>

<p>`.` (period) is used to get the value stored at a key inside an object.
`drawableSnake.color` says "get me the value of the color key in the
drawableSnake variable." What do you think that value is?</p>

<p>`(` and `)` (parenthesis) also come in pairs. When they come after a
variable, they are saying "run the code stored in this variable." A variable
that stores code that can be run is called a `function`. Values held within
the parenthesis are given to the `function` for whatever it's purpose may
be.  In this case, we want to give a collection of drawable things to
CHUNK's draw function so it can draw them on the screen.</p>
