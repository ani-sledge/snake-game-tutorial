lesson_js: lesson-7.js

<p>To change the direction of the snake, we need to change the direction of
it's first segment. Add the following function to snake.js:</p>

<pre>
var changeDirection = function(direction) {
  snake[0].direction = direction;
}
</pre>

<p>Next, we'll have CHUNK call changeDirection when an arrow key is pressed.
Add the following line at the end of snake.js:</p>

<pre>
  CHUNK.onArrowKey(changeDirection);
</pre>

{% include expected-results.html %}

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>
<p>`CHUNK.onArrowKey` Tells chunk to call the changeDirection function every
time an arrow key is pressed.</p>
