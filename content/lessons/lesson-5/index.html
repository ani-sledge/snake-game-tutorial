title: Lesson 5 - Make CHUNK move the snake for us
lesson_js: lesson-5.js
---

<p>Hooray! We can both draw and move the snake! Of course, having our users
copy and paste lines of code into their javascript console isn't a wonderful 
idea, so we're going to have CHUNK execute the move and draw commands for us.</p>

<p>We'll start with an `advanceGame` function</p>

<pre>
var advanceGame = function() {
  snake = moveSnake(snake);
  drawSnake(snake);
}
</pre>

<p>To get this function running we'll use our CHUNK game engine to CALL the `executeNTimesPerSecond` function. It does exactly that, to do this `executeNTimesPerSecond` takes in two arguments. The first arugement advances the game, and the second tells it how many times to move per-second.</p>

<pre>
CHUNK.executeNTimesPerSecond(advanceGame, 1);
</pre>

<p>Bam! Now the snake moves down until it runs off the game screen.</p>

<p>Because functions are just another kind of value (like numbers, arrays, objects, strings, 
etc.) we can pass them as arguments to other functions.</p>
