title: Lesson 8 - Ending the Game When A Wall Is Hit

<p>Games aren't much fun if you can't lose them! Let's make it so when you hit
a wall. CHUNK comes with a function to detect collisions between things, so
we'll use that.</p>

<p>Add an `if` statement to the `advanceGame` function like so:</p>

{% highlight js %}
var advanceGame = function() {
  snake = moveSnake(snake);
  if (CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween(snake, CHUNK.gameBoundaries())) {
    CHUNK.endGame();
    CHUNK.flashMessage("Woops! you hit a wall!");
  }
  drawSnake(snake);
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now, when there is a collision between the snake and the border we can have
CHUNK end the game and let the player know the game is over.</p>

{% endhighlight %}

{% include expected-results.html %}

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween` takes two collections of coordinates and
returns true if the collections share any pixels</p>

<p>`CHUNK.endGame` tells chunk to stop calling the advanceGame function,
effectively ending the game.</p>

<p>`CHUNK.flashMessage` displays text to the user.</p>
