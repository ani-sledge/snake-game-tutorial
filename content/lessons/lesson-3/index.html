title: Lesson 3 - Drawing a Snake Multiple Times
layout: default
lesson_js: lesson-3.js

<p>Now that we have a snake being drawn on the screen, We're going
to want to be able to draw it many times, for instance every time
it moves.</p>

<p>To do this, we'll define a function which draws the snake
it's given. Add the following line to the beginning of
game/snake.js:</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Functions are objects in Javascript that wrap a set of statements,
and are meant to be reusable.</p>

<p>You'll notice this is similar to how we used the `var` keyword
and `=` symbol to create the snake earlier. The only difference
is instead of assigning a list of objects to a variable, we're
assigning a chunk of code that we want to use later.</p>

<p>Now all we have to do is call drawSnake with a snake and it
will be drawn on the screen! Write the following under the
drawSnake function.</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
  drawSnake(snake);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Javascript interprets code from top to bottom. This means we can't call
functions until after we've defined them. Make sure you put this code at the
end of the `snake.js` file.</p>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open up the console and play around with making the
  snake move by calling `drawSnake` with snakes that have
  different `top` and `left` values for their segment.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`function() { }` says "Hey, between the curly braces is some
code we want to be able to execute." Functions can be stored inside
variables just like words and numbers and objects and lists.</p>

<p>`(` and `)` in this case are a way to say that this function expects
a value to be given to it when it is called. These values are called
`arguments`, and can be used inside of the function body (the code between
the curly braces).</p>
