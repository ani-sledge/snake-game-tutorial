title: Lesson 3 - Drawing a Snake Multiple Times
layout: default
lesson_js: lesson-3.js
---
<p>Now that we have a snake being drawn on the screen, We're going
to want to be able to draw it many times, for instance every time
it moves.</p>

<p>To do this, we'll define a function which draws the snake
it's given. Add the following line to the beginning of
game/snake.js:</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var drawSnake = function(snakeToDraw) {
    var drawableSnake = { color: "green", pixels: snakeToDraw };
    var drawableObjects = [drawableSnake];
    CHUNK.draw(drawableObjects);
  }
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Functions are a way to group instructions so they're easy for humans to
understand or so the computer can use them over and over without us writing
the code out multiple times.</p>

<p>Functions exist somewhat independently from the code around them; this means
that if the function needs variables from the rest of the code base they should
be passed in as arguments. The `drawSnake` function takes a single argument,
`snakeToDraw` which it then uses to create the `drawableSnake`.

<p>Now all we have to do is call drawSnake with a snake and it will be drawn on
the screen! Write the following under the drawSnake function.</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0}];
  drawSnake(snake);
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Because Javascript interprets code from top to bottom we can't call
functions until after we've defined them. Make sure you put this code at the
end of the `snake.js` file.</p>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Open up the console and play around with making the
  snake move by calling `drawSnake` with snakes that have
  different `top` and `left` values for their segment.</li>
  <li>Try to access `drawableSnake` from outside of the `drawSnake` function.
  Check the javascript console.</li>
  <li>Try to access `snake` inside of the `drawSnake` function. Check the
  javascript console.</li>
  <li>Why do you suppose you could access one but not the other? What variables
  are availble where is known as <a
  href="http://javascript.about.com/library/bltut07.htm">scoping</a> and is a
fundamental building block of programming.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`function() { }` says "Hey, between the curly braces is some
code we want to be able to execute." Functions can be stored inside
variables just like words and numbers and objects and lists.</p>

<p>`(` and `)` in this case are a way to say that this function expects
a value to be given to it when it is called. These values are called
`arguments`, and can be used inside of the function body (the code between
the curly braces).</p>
