title: Lesson 9 - Moving a Multiple Segment Snake
layout: default
lesson_js: lesson-9.js

<p>Now that we can crash into a wall, lets have a snake longer than a single
segment!</p>

<p>Currently, the `moveSnake` function only moves the first segment in the
snake. Let's make it to move every segment! Change `moveSnake` to the
following:</p>

{% highlight js %}
var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var newSnake = [];
  snake.forEach(function(oldSegment) {
    var newSegment = moveSegment(oldSegment);
    newSegment.direction = oldSegment.direction;
    newSnake.push(newSegment);
  });

  return newSnake;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>`forEach` introduces `looping`. Looping allows us to do something multiple
times. Looping (for, while, forEach, etc) and conditionals (if, switch)` both
allow you to control the flow of the program.</p>

<p>Now that we can move many segments across the screen, let's add a second
segment to our snake. Change the line that starts with `var snake = ...` to the
following:</p>

{% highlight js %}
  var snake = [{ top: 1, left: 0, direction: "down" }, { top: 0, left: 0, direction: "down" }];
{% endhighlight %}

{% include expected-results.html %}

<p>You'll notice that if you play the game, the second segment always just
moves down. This is OK for now!</p>


<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>
<p>`array.forEach` allows us to call a function with each item in a collection.
This is a very common kind of loop and is very powerful.</p>

<p>`array.push` adds the element it is given to the array it is called in.</p>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">`array.map`</a>
  is another kind of loop that makes it easy to build a new collection from an
  existing collection. Rewrite the `moveSnake` function to use `array.map`
  instead of `array.forEach`</li>
  <li>The
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">`for`</a>
  and
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while">`while`</a>
  loops are also quite common. They are more generally useful but harder to use
  than the collection based `forEach` and `map` functions. How could you write
  moveSnake with either `for` or `while`?</li>
</ul>
