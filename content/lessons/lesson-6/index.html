title: Lesson 6 - Snake can move in every direction

<p>Now that the snake is moving on it's own, let's make it so it can move in
different directions!</p>

<p>First, we'll create a function that moves the segment based upon it's
direction (down, up, right, left):</p>

{% highlight js %}
var moveSegment = function(segment) {
  if (segment.direction === "down") {
    return { top: segment.top + 1, left: segment.left }
  } else if (segment.direction === "up") {
    return { top: segment.top - 1, left: segment.left }
  } else if (segment.direction === "right") {
    return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left + 1 }
  } else if (segment.direction === "left") {
    return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left - 1 }
  }
  return segment;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>`if` statements choose what code to run. Here a series of `if` and `else if`s
to return a new object with coordinates offset from the passed in segment.</p>

<p>When the passed in segment doesn't have a direction or it doesn't match the
directions in our `if`/`else if` then we return the original segment object.</p>

<p>Our returned segment doesn't have a direction; which means the snake will
only move once! To keep the snake moving we need to assign every `newSegment` a
direction.</p>

<p>Let's change our `moveSnake` function to give the `newSegment` the same
direction as the `oldSegment`. This will keep the snake moving in the same
direction.</p>

{% highlight js %}
var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var oldSegment = snake[0];
  var newSegment = moveSegment(oldSegment);
  newSegment.direction = oldSegment.direction;
  var newSnake = [newSegment];
  return newSnake;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Next add a direction to our initial snakes segments.</p>

<p>
var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0, direction: "down" }];
</p>
<p>Now our snake knows where to start moving!</p>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use a switch statement instead of a series of ifs</li>
  <li>Make sure each direction works!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`===` tells the computer to check for EXACT equality. For example: "down" === "down" will return true but "down" === "DOWN" will return false.</p>
