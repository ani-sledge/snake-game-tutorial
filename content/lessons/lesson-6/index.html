title: Lesson 6 - Snake can move in every direction

<p>Now that the snake is moving on it's own, let's make it so it can move in
different directions!</p>

<p>First, we'll create a function that moves the segment based upon it's
direction (down, up, right, left):</p>

{% highlight js %}
var moveSegment = function(segment) {
  if (segment.direction === "down") {
    return { top: segment.top + 1, left: segment.left }
  } else if (segment.direction === "up") {
    return { top: segment.top - 1, left: segment.left }
  } else if (segment.direction === "right") {
    return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left + 1 }
  } else if (segment.direction === "left") {
    return { top: segment.top, left: segment.left - 1 }
  }
  return segment;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The `if` statement allows us to make choices about what code to execute
based upon values. Here we use a series of `if` and `else if`s to create a
new segment at its next location. In the event the direction isn't one of
the 4 we want, we return the original segment. The `direction` is a key
we will be passing into `snake`.</p>

<p>Once a segment is moved, we give it a direction to move in the next time.
Otherwise the snake will just stop moving! This means we'll updating our 
`moveSnake` function.</p>

{% highlight js %}
var moveSnake = function(snake) {
  var oldSegment = snake[0];
  var newSegment = moveSegment(oldSegment);
  newSegment.direction = oldSegment.direction;
  var newSnake = [newSegment];
  return newSnake;
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Now it's time to add a direction to the starting snake's segments so it knows where to go.</p>

<p>
var snake = [{ top: 0, left: 0, direction: "down" }];
</p>

{% include expected-results.html %}

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Use a switch statement instead of a series of ifs</li>
  <li>Change the starting snakes segments to ensure all the directions work.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`===` tells the computer to check for EXACT equality. For example: "down" === "down" will return true but "down" === "DOWN" will return false.</p>
