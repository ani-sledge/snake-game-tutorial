title: Lesson 12 - Growing the snake when it eats an apple!
lesson_js: lesson-12.js
---

<p>Now that an apple appears on the screen, we can make eating it grow
the snake.</p>

<p>To do that, we'll create a stationary copy of the snakes last segment. When
the snake moves next the copied segment will stay in place, causing it to
"grow" on the screen.</p>

<pre>
var growSnake = function(snake) {
  var indexOfLastSegment = snake.length - 1;
  var lastSegment = snake[snake.length - 1];
  snake.push({ top: lastSegment.top, left: lastSegment.left });
  return snake;
}
</pre>

<p>Now that we have a function to grow the snake, let's check for a collision
between the apple and the snake whenever the game advances. Let's change the
`advanceGame` function so it looks like this:</p>

<pre>
var advanceGame = function() {
  snake = moveSnake(snake);
  if (CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween([apple], snake)) {
    snake = growSnake(snake);
    apple = CHUNK.randomLocation();
  }
  if (CHUNK.detectCollisionBetween(snake, CHUNK.gameBoundaries())) {
    CHUNK.endGame();
    CHUNK.flashMessage("Woops! you hit a wall!");
  }
  draw(snake, apple);
}
</pre>

<h3>Play Time!</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When is the newly added segment given a direction to move in?</li>
  <li>Why do we put the `apple` variable inside of `[]` when we call
  `detectCollision`</li>
</ul>

<h3>Syntax Breakdown</h3>

<p>`array.length` tells us how many elements are in a list. Arrays are zero
indexed, so we subtract one to get the index of the last element in the
list.</p>
