<h1>Snake in JavaScript, Lesson 1</h1>

<p>Today, we're going to recreate the classic game snake in the Javascript
programming language.</p>

<canvas id="chunk-game" height="600" width="800"></canvas>

<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/chunk.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="../js/snake.js"></script>

<h3>Download the tutorial</h3>
<p>Before you can start the tutorial, you'll need to download it to your computer
to edit the source code. Start by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Forking <a href="https://github.com/zspencer/snake-game-tutorial">this
    repository</a></li>
  <li>Cloning your fork to your computer</li>
</ul>

<h3>Launch your programming environment</h3>
<p>When programming, there's generally four tools you'll want on hand:</p>
<li>Your browser to see the code running (I recommend Chrome)</li>
<li>A text editor to change the code (I recommend <a
  href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>)</li>
<li>A javascript console so you can experiment and print out debugging
messages. These are built into your browser. <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">Here</a> are instructions on setting up developer tools on chrome.</li>

<p>Once you have these tools available, we need to open the files we'll be working with:</p>

</ul>
  <li>Open game/snake.js in your text editor</li>
  <li>Open game/index.html in your browser</li>
  <li>Open your browsers javascript console</li>
  <li>type <pre>alert("hello world");</pre> in your browsers javascript console
  and dismiss the window that pops up<br />
  <img src='images/helloworld.png'
  height="300" width="600"></li>
</ul>

<h3>Stop and reflect</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Github allows you to share your code with other developers so they can
  remix it. What other reasons would you want to share your code on github?</li>
  <li>The javascript console allows you to try out code and is one of the
  fastest ways to get feedback on if the code will work or not. What other ways
  can you get feedback on whether or not your code will work?</li>
  <li>Why shouldn't you use Word or Google Docs to edit code?</li>
</ul>
