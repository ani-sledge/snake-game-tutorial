<h1>Snake in JavaScript, Lesson 1</h1>

<p>Programming is fun! It's one of the few activities where you can set out to
create something that only exists in your head.</p>

<p>Today, we're going to re-create the classic game snake:</p>

<p>Because programming offers such a derth of possibility, it requires some
forethought. Take a moment to break down the relatively large problem of "build
a snake game" into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>Does your list look something like this?</p>

<pre class="my-features">
Turn the snake if an arrow key is pressed
Put a new apple out if the snake eats an apple
End the game if the snake hits a wall
Grow the snake if it eats an apple
Draw the game on the screen while the game is running
End the game if the snake hits itself
</pre>

<p>This is one-of-many possible ways to express the rules of the snake game.
There is no right or wrong way to break down a problem, though some ways are
easier to implement in code than others.</p>

<p>There are two keywords in this example: <span class="code">if</span> and
<span class="code">while</span>. These words are flow control keywords, and are
part of the javascript programming language. Flow control is a fundamental
building block of programming. It lets us have the computer make decisions or
repeat something. Armed with this knowledge, we can take our list of rules and
turn it into something code-like:</p>

<pre>
while (gameIsRunnning()) {
  if(arrowKeyIsPressed()) {
     changeSnakeDirection();
  }

  if (snakeEatsTheApple()) {
    growSnake();
    placeANewApple();
  }

  if (snakeEatsItself()) {
    endTheGame();
  }

  if (snakeHitsTheWall()) {
    endTheGame();
  }

  if (gameIsRunning()) {
    drawTheGame();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>This is what's known as pseudo-code. We sketch out what we think the code
will be as if we're writing for a human and it helps us notice possible logic
errors.</p>

<p>While this may not exactly be the code we implement it is a reasonable start.
Over the next lessons we'll make a working game.</p>
